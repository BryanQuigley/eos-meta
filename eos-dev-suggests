# Such packages aren't installed by default when you install eos-dev.
# The main purpose of listing packages here is so that they aren't considered
# for deletion by scripts that look for unused packages in our distro. Such
# scripts have special provisions to consider anything listed here as a
# required part of our distro.

# It will probably be added to the ostree once ready.
